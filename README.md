
UVM/SystemC Demonstration Project
=================================

About The Project
-----------------

This UVM/SystemC Demonstration Project provides a demonstration of 
the UVM methodology and tools implemented using SystemC.

Existing, simple, verified modules implemented in SystemC were used
as the targets of this project.  The original tests used to verify
the target modules were constructed using an ad-hoc mechanism which
was composed atop SystemC.  In this project, the ad-hoc mechanism
used previously is replaced using the elements of the UVM/SystemC
beta reference implementaiton.

The Accellera SystemC and UVM/SystemC reference libraries are used
for this project.  These implementations were selected, as they
are 1) open source, and 2) compatable with both Windows and Linux.

### Caveats

A "caveat" is a warning or a caution.  In this project several
choices were at the outset due to technology, compilation, and
tools' compatibility issues.  These include:

1. The SystemC 2.3.4 reference implementation was selected, as the
available reference implementation of UVM/SystemC (1.0-beta5) was not
compatible with the available SystemC 3.0.0 implementation.

2. The C++ 2020 standard was selected, as it is the most recent
standard combatible with the SystemC and UVM/SystemC reference
implementations.  The C++ 2023 standard deprecates, or alters,
several language features used by the reference implementations.
As the project goals do not include active maintenance of the
reference implementaitons, the most-recent, compatible standard
was used.

3. Several compilation issues were found in the Windows reference
implementations of SystemC and UVM/SystemC.  For example, some MSVC
library incompatabilities were found.  The issues identified during
the development of this project were resolved as part of the install
process.

4. This project's use of the C++ 2020 standard is incompatible with
most of the default SystemC library packages installed under the
contemporary Linux distributions.  Local builds and static linking
are used to avoid problems which would otherwise occurr from
dynamic linking with nominal SystemC library installations.
